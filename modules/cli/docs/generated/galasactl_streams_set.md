## galasactl streams set

Creates or updates a test stream in the Galasa service

### Synopsis

Creates or updates a test stream in the Galasa service. When creating a new test stream, you must provide a test catalog URL, Maven repository URL, and at least one OBR. When updating an existing test stream, you only need to supply the parameter that you wish to update and that parameter will be overwritten with your new value.

```
galasactl streams set [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --description string       the description to associate with the test stream being created or updated
  -h, --help                     Displays the options for the 'streams set' command.
      --maven-repo-url string    the URL to the Maven repository containing test material for the test stream to use. For example: https://my-maven-repository
      --name string              A mandatory field indicating the name of a test stream.
      --obr strings              The Maven coordinates of the OBR bundle(s) which refer to your test bundles. The format of this parameter is 'mvn:{OBR_GROUP_ID}/{OBR_ARTIFACT_ID}/{OBR_VERSION}/obr'. Multiple instances of this flag can be used to describe multiple OBR bundles.
      --testcatalog-url string   the URL to the test catalog for the test stream being created or updated. For example: https://my-maven-repository/path/to/testcatalog.json
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -b, --bootstrap string                      Bootstrap URL. Should start with 'http://' or 'file://'. If it starts with neither, it is assumed to be a fully-qualified path. If missing, it defaults to use the 'bootstrap.properties' file in your GALASA_HOME. Example: http://example.com/bootstrap, file:///user/myuserid/.galasa/bootstrap.properties , file://C:/Users/myuserid/.galasa/bootstrap.properties
      --galasahome string                     Path to a folder where Galasa will read and write files and configuration settings. The default is '${HOME}/.galasa'. This overrides the GALASA_HOME environment variable which may be set instead.
  -l, --log string                            File to which log information will be sent. Any folder referred to must exist. An existing file will be overwritten. Specify "-" to log to stderr. Defaults to not logging.
      --rate-limit-retries int                The maximum number of retries that should be made when requests to the Galasa Service fail due to rate limits being exceeded. Must be a whole number. Defaults to 3 retries (default 3)
      --rate-limit-retry-backoff-secs float   The amount of time in seconds to wait before retrying a command if it failed due to rate limits being exceeded. Defaults to 1 second. (default 1)
