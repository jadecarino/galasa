# 0.39.0 - Release Highlights

- Forks and fork builds are now supported making it easier to contribute to Galasa!

- All Galasa components now use a common version number.

- CPS property names can now include the '@' character.

- The `galasactl runs get` command supports a new `--group` option to query test runs by the group ID they were launched with.

- Gherkin now respects the `framework.continue.on.test.failure` flag so it doesn't need to exit a feature when the first scenario fails.

- This release also includes instability fixes, and dependency updates.
