[The Galasa Ecosystem](../ecosystem/index.md) features a REST API that you can use to interact with your ecosystem and perform several tasks, for example, retrieving test artifacts, configuring CPS properties, and submitting test runs, allowing you to create integrations with your own applications.

The REST API documentation can be found on the [Galasa Ecosystem API documentation page](https://rest.galasa.dev/){target="_blank"}.
