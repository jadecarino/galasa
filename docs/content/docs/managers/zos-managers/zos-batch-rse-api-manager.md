title: "z/OS Batch RSE API Manager"
---

This Manager is at Alpha level. You can view the [Javadoc documentation for the Manager](https://javadoc.galasa.dev/index.html){target="_blank"}.


## Overview

This Manager is an internal implementation of the z/OS Batch Manager using RSE API. The RSE API Batch Manager is used in conjunction with the z/OS Manager. The z/OS Manager provides the interface for the z/OS batch function and pulls in the RSE API Batch Manager to provide the implementation of the interface. If your test needs to submit or monitor a batch job or retrieve output from a batch job, you can call the z/OS Manager in your test code and the z/OS Manager will call the RSE API Batch Manager to provide the implementation via the z/OS batch  function. For example, the [BatchAccountsOpenTest](../../running-simbank-tests/batch-accounts-open-test.md)  uses the z/OS Manager (which in the background, invokes RSE API) to add a set of accounts to the Galasa SimBank  system via a z/OS batch job.

The zOS Batch RSE API Manager is enabled by setting the CPS property: `zos.bundle.extra.batch.manager=dev.galasa.zosbatch.rseapi.manager`

See the [zOS Manager](../zos-managers/zos-manager.md) for details of the z/OS Batch annotations and code snippets.
