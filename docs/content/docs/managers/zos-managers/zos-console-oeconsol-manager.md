title: "zOS Console oeconsol Manager"
---

This Manager is at Alpha level. You can view the [Javadoc documentation for the Manager](https://javadoc.galasa.dev/overview-summary.html){target="_blank"}.


## Overview

This Manager is the internal implementation of the z/OS Console Manager using **oeconsol**. The **oeconsol** z/OS Console Manager is used in conjunction  with the z/OS UNIX Command Manager. The z/OS Manager provides the interface for the z/OS console function and pulls in the **oeconsol** Console Manager  to provide the implementation of the interface. If your test needs to request a z/OS console instance, issue a console command or retrieve the console  command, you can call the z/OS Manager in your test code and the z/OS Manager will call the **oeconsol** Console Manager to provide the implementation  via the z/OS console function. Multiple z/OS console images can be requested by a test.

See the [zOS Manager](./zos-manager.md) for details of the z/OS Console Annotations.

This implementation is less rich than the zOS/MF implementation due to the restricted functionallity of **oeconsol**:

- **oeconsol** does not directly support console name.

    Console name can be used to avoid clashes with other consoles that the user has open, e.g. in another Galsa test, in a TSO or SDSF session. When supplying console name via `IZosConsole#issueCommand(String command, String consoleName)` the Manager attempts to obtain credentials from the CPS, i.e. `secure.credentials.[consoleName].username`. The credentials are used to logon to z/OS UNIX and execute **oeconsol** with the supplied command.

- **oeconsol** does not support retrieving delayed responses.

    A `ZosConsoleException` is will be thrown when the `IZosConsoleCommand#requestResponse()` method is called.
