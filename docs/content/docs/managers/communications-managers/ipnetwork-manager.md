title: "IP Network Manager"
---

This Manager is at Release level. You can view the [Javadoc documentation for the Manager](https://javadoc.galasa.dev/dev/galasa/ipnetwork/package-summary.html){target="_blank"}.


## Overview

The IP Network Manager enables access to applications over TCP/IP networks for those applications whose native communication is over TCP/IP.
It can be used by other application specific managers that will build upon the basic address capabilities provided by the IP Network Manager.

The Manager interrogates the Configuration Properties Store (CPS) to get hostname and port information so that you do not need to hard-code these values into your tests.
