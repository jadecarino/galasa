# Galasa 

This is the main source code repository for the Galasa open source project.

## Code structure
- [`modules`](./modules/) - The code
- [`tools`](./tools/) - Build tools and useful scripts
- [`docs`](./docs/) - The source code for our [preview](https://vnext.galasa.dev) and [live](https://galasa.dev) documentation sites


## Building locally

When setting up galasa locally, you can either use [(1) our development container (recommended set up)](#1-recommended-set-up-dev-container) or [(2) a manual set up](#2-manual-set-up).


### (1) Recommended set up (dev container)

1. Install a code editor that has Dev Container support, in this setup we will be using Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) VSCode extension by Microsoft.
3. Clone the repository.
4. Install and open a container engine, such as Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop or Podman.
5. Open the project in a dev container via the VSCode extension.
- Note: Changing your environment variables will require you to restart VSCode for the changes to be reflected in the container.


### (2) Manual set up

Some tools will need to be installed in order to build this code locally.
See our install instructions [here](./developer-docs/install-pre-req-tools.md).


### To build...

Use the `./tools/build-locally.sh` script. `--help` shows you the options.

Basic usage to build everything: `build-locally.sh`


## setting the source code version

The `set-version.sh` script allows you to set the version of the Galasa throughout this repository.

Use the `--help` flag to see what options are supported.

Basic usage: `set-version.sh --version 0.48.0`


## Using vscode

When using vscode to develop this code, we recommend the following settings are added to your `settings.json` file:

```
"java.jdt.ls.vmargs": "-Xmx1024m",
"java.import.gradle.arguments" : "-PtargetMaven=~/.m2/repository",

"java.import.gradle.version": "8.9",
"java.configuration.runtimes": [
    {
        "name": "JavaSE-17",
        "path": "/path/to/java/sdk/folder" , // eg: /Users/mcobbett/.sdkman/candidates/java/17.0.12-tem
        "default": true,
    },
],
"java.import.gradle.wrapper.enabled": false,
"java.gradle.buildServer.enabled": "off",
```
